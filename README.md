design of unit tests can occur before coding begins or after source code has been generated. A
review of design information provides guidance for establishing test cases that are likely to
uncover errors in each of the categories. Each test case should be coupled with a set of
expected results.
Because a component is not a stand-alone program, driver and/or stub software must often be
developed for each unit test. The unit test environment is illustrated in Figure 17.4. In most
applications a driver is nothing more than a “main program” that accepts test case data, passes
such data to the component (to be tested), and prints relevant results.
